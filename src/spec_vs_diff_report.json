  "summary": "Diff adds a single-page frontend with top navigation, multiple science content sections, references data, a disclaimer banner, and a footer that credits the requested authors. It also introduces Internet Identity/auth-related hooks and provider wiring, and references one required hero image asset path. However, the diff does not show the required generated image files under frontend/public/assets/generated nor usage of the other two required images.",
