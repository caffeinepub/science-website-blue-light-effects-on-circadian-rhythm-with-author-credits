# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a responsive, science-focused informational website explaining how blue light affects circadian rhythm, with clear navigation, references, and author credits.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a responsive single-page (or small multi-route) site with top navigation that jumps to each major section.
- Write clear English content covering: what blue light is, circadian rhythm/melatonin basics, biological mechanism (ipRGCs/melanopsin and alerting effects), evidence summary, mitigation strategies, and cautions/limitations with a visible disclaimer.
- Add a References section with a short bibliography-style list of credible sources, avoiding overly specific uncited numerical claims.
- Add a consistent science-education visual theme (palette, typography, spacing) that avoids a generic blue/purple look.
- Display author credits exactly as: “PushpakSaha” and “Md. Zawraiz Khan” in a consistent location (e.g., footer/about).
- Generate and include static educational images stored under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and render them in relevant sections (no backend image serving).

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate a clean, science-themed site (mobile/desktop) to learn about blue light and circadian rhythm, see supporting visuals, read practical tips and limitations, view references, and find clear author attribution.
